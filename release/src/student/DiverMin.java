	 * you must return from this function in order to pick<br>
	 * it up. If you continue to move after finding the ring rather <br>
	 * than returning, it will not count.<br>
	 * If you return from this function while not standing on top of the ring, <br>
	 * it will count as a failure.
	 *
	 * There is no limit to how many steps you can take, but you will receive<br>
	 * a score bonus multiplier for finding the ring in fewer steps.
	 *
	 * At every step, you know only your current tile's ID and the ID of all<br>
	 * open neighbor tiles, as well as the distance to the ring at each of <br>
	 * these tiles (ignoring walls and obstacles).
	 *
	 * In order to get information about the current state, use functions<br>
	 * currentLocation(), neighbors(), and distanceToRing() in state.<br>
	 * You know you are standing on the ring when distanceToRing() is 0.
	 *
	 * Use function moveTo(long id) in state to move to a neighboring<br>
	 * tile by its ID. Doing this will change state to reflect your new position.
	 *
	 * A suggested first implementation that will always find the ring, but <br>
	 * likely won't receive a large bonus multiplier, is a depth-first walk. <br>
	 * Some modification is necessary to make the search better, in general. */

	/** Flee the sewer system before the steps are all used, trying to <br>
	 * collect as many coins as possible along the way. Your solution must ALWAYS <br>
	 * get out before the steps are all used, and this should be prioritized above<br>
	 * collecting coins.
	 *
	 * You now have access to the entire underlying graph, which can be accessed<br>
	 * through FleeState. currentNode() and getExit() will return Node objects<br>
	 * of interest, and getNodes() will return a collection of all nodes on the graph.
	 *
	 * You have to get out of the sewer system in the number of steps given by<br>
	 * getStepsRemaining(); for each move along an edge, this number is <br>
	 * decremented by the weight of the edge taken.
	 *
	 * Use moveTo(n) to move to a node n that is adjacent to the current node.<br>
	 * When n is moved-to, coins on node n are automatically picked up.
	 *
	 * You must return from this function while standing at the exit. Failing <br>
	 * to do so before steps run out or returning from the wrong node will be<br>
	 * considered a failed run.
	 *
	 * Initially, there are enough steps to get from the starting point to the<br>
	 * exit using the shortest path, although this will not collect many coins.<br>
	 * For this reason, a good starting solution is to use the shortest path to<br>
	 * the exit. */
